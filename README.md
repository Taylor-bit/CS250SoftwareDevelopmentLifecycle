# CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle
A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course at Southern New Hampshire University. Through these efforts, I examined the relationship between technical expertise and teamwork, considering how to develop software solutions that have an impact on users.

# Reflections

# Interpreting User Needs & Implementing Them
The foundation of developing software that addresses real-world issues is understanding the needs of users. I make sure that the development process remains in line with the objectives of the user by obtaining requirements from user feedback and converting them into actionable user stories. I can prioritize features and clarify user expectations by using user stories to break down requirements into achievable tasks. The application will be developed in tandem with user input thanks to this iterative approach, making the final product more functional and user-friendly.

# Approaching Program Development
I place a high value on an organized and iterative process when developing applications. I begin by gathering requirements and planning, and I frequently use wireframes, diagrams, or pseudocode to visualize workflows. Project organization and flexibility have been maintained through the use of Agile techniques including Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, and Retrospectives. Agile's focus on iterative development and ongoing feedback keeps me adaptable and helps me effectively handle unforeseen obstacles. In order to boost teamwork and project results, I want to further embrace Agile principles in the future.

# Being a Good Team Member
In software development, being a good team player entails encouraging accountability, open communication, and teamwork. I make an effort to help my teammates by sharing information, paying attention to their suggestions, and continuously supporting the team's objectives. It also entails adjusting to different working styles and keeping a problem-solving attitude in the face of difficulties. I want to foster a productive team atmosphere where everyone's efforts are appreciated by placing a strong emphasis on mutual respect and trust, which will ultimately lead to the project's success.
